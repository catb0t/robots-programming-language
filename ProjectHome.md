The ROBOT programming language offers a unique and enjoyable learning experience to the beginning programmer. It provides an interesting but also challenging problem domain which is intuitive to humans. The language is highly overloaded so users at all levels of exposure to math and programming concepts will be comfortable with standard operations. The interpreted design allows for constant compiler feedback and guidance during the programming process while the visual execution environment and robot avatar gives a clear display of the program in execution.
