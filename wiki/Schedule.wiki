=Thoughts=
  * First, test without automatic class loader and without 3D viewer.
  * Use standard output.
  * IR design
  * overload each operator by a function. ex : "+" -> "Func.add(param1,param2)" to avoid type checking
  * keep track of the line in Lex program : "Func.add(param1,param2,line number)" to give a good error feedback to the user

= Weekly Meeting =
