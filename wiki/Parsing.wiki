= Compiling the compiler =

Code location: svn/trunk/PLT/src/Compiler/

Make sure that JFlex.jar and cup.jar are in the class path.
These instructions are specifically for Linux but they do not differ too much form what you would do on other OSs. Let me know if you face issues compiling and running the code. Currently, the compiler reads a file called hello.robot from the current directory and sends the synthesized Java code to stdout.



1. $ java java_cup.Main robot.cup

2. $ jflex robot.lex

3. $ javac -d . parser.java sym.java Yylex.java

4. $ java Robot.parser
