  # Unit Test using JUnit
    * [http://open.ncsu.edu/se/tutorials/junit/ Unit Testing in Eclipse Using JUnit] 
    * Every functions must have at least *two test functions*.
    * Generally *do NOT use "test????? (e.g. testAlgorithm)" as function name except for test case*.
    * Download and run "SampleJUnit" from Source tab.
  # Integral Test
    * Translator
        * Sample code 1 <-> Java Code 1
        * Sample code 2 <-> Java Code 2
        * Sample code 3 <-> Java Code 3
    * Integral Function
        * Running the user program and evaluate its functionality
